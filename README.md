### Inspiration

- [Go PHP 7](https://github.com/gophp7/gophp7.github.io/edit/master/index.html)
- [Go PHP 5](https://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/go-php-5-go)

"The solution a few people suggested was team work. If all PHP projects stopped supporting PHP 4 and made the jump to PHP 5 at the same time, none of them is penalized in the market for being "first" and web hosts will have a clear business case to upgrade their systems to PHP 5. We can then all start offering faster, cleaner, more powerful, more secure web software.

But how does one get all PHP projects together to agree on something like that? Actually, it's fairly simple. You ask them."
